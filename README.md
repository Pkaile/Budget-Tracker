# Budget-Tracker
Budget Tracker v1
This project is a basic budget tracker but I plan on adding PHP and a MYSQL back-end. I also plan on adding authentication as well as adding charts and the ability to:
Version 2:
-export as a CSV file.  
-view different graphs/ charts of expenses and income 
-recieve email alerts when certain thresholds are met
-Email reminders for subs and recurring payments
-view a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly expenses.
-Authentication
-Login/ Signup screen
Thanks for checking my project out!
